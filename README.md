Simple Android App similar to the example given. A little different than the Udacity tutorial as it was created on a much newer version of android studio and actually uses Kotlin instead of JAVA. Used the example code from the UDACITY course and the conversion tool in android studio to create the final version of the Action handler for the button. Actually very similar to the GUI programming I do professionally using Microsoft Visual Studio, C# and Windows Presentation format (WPF) or C++ and QT.
